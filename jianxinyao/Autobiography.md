Autobiography
Xinyao JIAN, Nanchang No.2 Middle School

 “A real progressive person must take the responsibility to help others instead of regarding ‘loneliness’, ‘progress’ as own path.” It always crosses my mind when I walk pass the statue of Mr. Zou Taofen, which is in front of the teaching building of Nanchang No.2 Middle School.

In September of 2016, I started my study in Supu Campus of Nanchang No.2 Middle School as the No.30 in the Senior High School Entrance Examination (and the No.2 in Nanchang Middle School) in Nanchang City. During 3-years study, I worked hard with a health manner and was always among the front rank of the grade.

In 2019, I got No.1 during the Evaluation Examination among senior year students with a total of 15926, ranking at No.20 in Nanchang; in April of the same year, I was No.2 in the 14-schools Joint Examination (including Changjun Middle School) ,and ranking No.14 in Nanchang with a slight difference of 5.5 compared to the first one.    

I was teachers’ right hand as a president, a representative of Chinese class and a Secretary of both publicity and life. To help managing our class actively, I have organized English Hypermarket, Blackboard Competition, Theatre Festival, etc. With the help of my classmates, the Blackboard Competition was ranked No.1 in the grade, while the English Hypermarket took the lead. In 2017, my essay “Walk to life” won the first prize on the essay competition regarding Social Practice Experience of Supu Campus of Nanchang No.2 Middle School. 

I have self-developed a lot during these three years, growing from a timid girl to a student with responsibility, recognized by teachers and classmates and was named as “2019 Excellent Student leaders of Nanchang”. I believe that I will get improved and better transformed in the upcoming four years in the university. Live with practice, work with approach; find your way when still young, and keep learning with no regrets.

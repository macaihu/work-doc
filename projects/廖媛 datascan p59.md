仍然希望考虑sierra wireless 和ucloudlink.  
邮件：  

We need to quote for the Sierra Wireless options and we can also quote for the EC25-AF option.   
I understand the Sierra Wireless is more expensive, but there is value in having it work throughout the world. We operate in 44 countries and it helps significantly to have a single fleet that works almost globally. The savings by having a single fleet will be compared with the additional cost.   
Have you had a chance to talk with GlocalMe/uCloudLink? I can send you our contact there if you would like.
